Making the tools that work for you.

##	The LayText keyboard:
The LayText keyboard is a keyboard **concept** specialized for professional use with the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) format.

### No LaTeX knowledge needed
The keyboard will be LaTeX-optional, meaning that the keys on the keyboard alone are enough to create a beautiful, high-quality document quickly.

<ins>Formatting example:</ins>
```
Pressing the [SQRT] key followed by the [x] and [^2] keys on the keyboard will automagically create the TeX \sqrt{x^2} and render it on the preview display.
```

###	Planned features:

####	All the keys you need
The LayText keyboard will have extra keys inspired by scientific calculators and customized by LaTeX enthusiasts.

#### The preview display
The keyboard will include a 3-line angled display to let you preview your statements before you write them out.

####	On-device compilation
All LaTeX typed on the keyboard on the keyboard will be rendered live on your device.

#### A bootable system
A bootable OS made for writing.
Made for schools that want to enable students to type on tests without the risk of cheating.
Will support printing and admin/guest permission managing.
